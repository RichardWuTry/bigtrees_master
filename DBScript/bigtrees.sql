(1, '访谈', 'Kiah Roache-Turner', 'Feature film-maker (Wyrmwood)', '2013/kiah.roache-turner.jpg', '<h4>Who are you, and what do you do?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>My name is Kiah Roache-Turner and I guess I could say that I’m an advertising director &amp; (more recently) a feature film-maker… but that would not be the case. What I am is an individual who is COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY OBSESSED with films. An absolute film geek and movie obsessive. All I ever wanted to be and all I ever will be is a Movie Director. In my civilian life I work for a fashion company part time creating online content and spend the other half of my REEL life making films, music videos and occasionally digital art for digital art’s sake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I just finished shooting my first full-length film ‘<a href="https://www.facebook.com/wyrmwoodmovie" title="Wyrmwood''s Facebook page.">Wyrmwood</a>’ - a fantasy/horror/sci-fi/action/post-apocalyptic mash-up of a movie that took me and my producer brother 3 years to complete. It’s been the most difficult and rewarding thing I’ve ever attempted in my life. I poured my entire heart and soul into the project and bled sweat and tears to make sure I made one hell-ovva’ kick-arse first film and I feel I’ve succeeded - only time will tell, however… it’ll come out early next year.  </p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What hardware do you use?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I just bought a new <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/" title="The all-in-one Mac.">iMac</a> with which to edit the rough-cut of my fillum and it’s been working like a dream. As an arty aesthete I LOVE the design and workflow of Macs, however I hear that a custom-built PC gives you more grunt for your bucks and as I do a fair bit of complicated 3D rendering at work we recently made the switch (literally yesterday) so I may become a convert yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’ve shot pretty consistently on Canon DSLR’s (the <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=139&amp;modelid=11933" title="A 12 megapixel DSLR.">5D1</a>, the <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=139&amp;modelid=17662" title="A 21 megapixel DSLR.">5D2</a> &amp; the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS-1D" title="A 4 megapixel DSLR.">1D</a>) for the last few years. I think for certain projects (especially online work) these cameras are great - however, I’ve recently started using some much sexier cams and to be honest the difference is pretty huge. For ease of use and picture quality the <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/professional/products/professional_cameras/cinema_eos_cameras/eos_c300" title="A 35mm digital video camera.">Canon C300</a> and the <a href="http://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/product-NEXFS700UK/" title="A 4k digital video camera.">Sony FS700</a> are brilliant and the fact that you can do ‘HD’ 200 frames-per-second slow motion on the Sony is a HUGE plus for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href="http://www.red.com/products/epic/" title="A high-end 4k digital video camera.">Red EPIC</a> and the <a href="http://www.red.com/products/scarlet" title="A high-end 4k digital video camera.">Red Scarlet</a> are amazing cameras also - I shot a big chunk of my feature on these guys and was massively impressed with the results. They’ve got a very filmic look and the 4k RAW file capabilities give you an amount of flexibility in the ‘post grading’ process that the other cameras can’t come close to. I would certainly never think of shooting another film on a camera that coudn’t shoot in this format. I’m a big believer that if you’re good enough at what you do you should be able to make something as beautiful and moving with a 5 dollar camera as another guy could make with a hundred thousand dollar camera but… well, damn but you just can’t help but love those high-end toys!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>And what software?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I recently made the switch from <a href="http://www.apple.com/finalcutstudio/finalcutpro/" title="A nonlinear video editor.">Final Cut Pro</a> to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" title="A video editing suite.">Adobe Premiere</a> (for editing) and am (after only one day of cutting) a no-holds-barred convert. It is superior in every way, an absolute dream for any filmmaker to work with and not too hard to learn at all. I love that fact that you can drag any type of video file format directly onto the timeline without pre-conversion and the interactive ‘video thumbnails’ save a gargantuan amount of time when sorting through footage. I use <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects/" title="Motion graphics and video editing software.">After Effects</a> for all my 3D title &amp; design work and <a href="http://adobe.com/products/photoshop/" title="The infamous graphic editor.">Photoshop</a> a fair bit for various bits and pieces. I write all my scripts in <a href="http://www.finaldraft.com/products/final-draft/" title="Popular screenwriting software.">Final Draft</a> (a great program for writers) and a bunch of other programs that really aren’t worth mentioning.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What would be your dream setup?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>To be completely honest the longer I make films the longer I realise that my dream setup would probably be that everybody does everything for me - from a technical standpoint anyway. I’m fast learning that there are a lot of people out there who are far more technically minded than I am and far better at what they do but there are not many people who are better at speaking the language of cinema (that I know) and that is really what I should stick to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having said that, the one possible exception is probably editing - I truly love losing myself in an edit and tend to prefer to do it solo. So…  my dream setup would be the latest disgustingly expensive Mac processor with three huge monitors, large subwoofers in a roomy, dark, leather-padded room with lush couches, a bar-fridge and a Thai masseuse on speed-dial waiting to assist me with the inevitable RSI that comes with editing 24 hours a day for months. Is that too much to ask?</p>', 'film,mac', '2013-11-19 20:24:46', 000, 1, '2013-11-19 12:24:52'),
(2, '访谈', 'Stephen Powell', 'Co-founder, Gustin', '2013/stephen.powell.jpg', '<h4>Who are you, and what do you do?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>My name is Stephen Powell, and I’m one of two founders of the menswear company <a href="http://www.weargustin.com/" title="The Gustin website.">Gustin</a>. We design and manufacture premium men’s clothing in SF, and use crowdsourcing to do it very efficiently - resulting in very low prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re a pretty small shop - I mainly work on our platform (outsourced), fulfillment (outsourced), marketing (outsourced), community management (in-house), and I take out the trash.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What hardware do you use?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>My personal technology stack is pretty standard for here in SF.\r\nMy laptop is a loaded 13” <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookair/" title="The super-thin Intel-based Mac laptop.">Macbook Air</a>. It’s the best laptop ever, super easy to drag around everywhere with me, and more than fast enough for the <a href="http://adobe.com/products/photoshop/" title="The infamous graphic editor.">Photoshop</a> work I have to do. I use my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_5S" title="A smartphone.">iPhone 5s</a> for photography (mostly <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252" title="A photo taking/sharing app.">Instagram</a>), and phone calls. My Macbook is almost always with me, so I do almost no work on my phone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think my favorite piece of hardware we have is <a href="http://instagram.com/p/eOWLw-DgZ6/" title="A photo of Gustin''s table">our table</a>. When we first moved into our space, we were working around a large dining table. Dining tables feel pretty narrow when you’ve got four people working with laptops, so we decided to build our own massive table. We constructed this using some old steel legs we had, and the top is built out of Williamsburg Butcher Block Co countertops. The whole thing is about 50” x 90”, which gives us plenty of room to spread out fabrics, samples, and get work done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also have an <a href="http://instagram.com/p/fBjaxTDgSE/" title="A photo of Gustin''s kickpress.">oldschool iron kickpress</a> in the office. We haven’t used it yet, but it’s a nice accent to our space.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>And what software?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I thought my answer to this was going to be pretty simple, but when I started listing it out, I realized that I rely on a lot more software than I would have thought. Roughly in order of importance, here’s what helps me run my life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://adiumx.com/" title="The excellent multi-chat-protocol Mac application.">Adium</a> for chatting - we use it to stay in constant communication with the team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/" title="A cloud storage service.">Google Drive</a> for sharing data around the team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://macromates.com/" title="A very popular text editor for the Mac.">TextMate</a> as my daily scratchpad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://www.pgadmin.org/" title="A GUI for managing PostgresSQL databases.">pgAdmin3</a> for querying our databases - this ends up getting dumped into <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/default.aspx" title="A popular spreadsheet application.">Excel</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://www.github.com/" title="A Git code repository service.">GitHub</a> for managing our codebase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://www.pandora.com/" title="A personalised Internet radio station.">Pandora</a> for the constant music in the office (played on our <a href="http://grainaudio.com/collections/handheld/products/pws" title="A wooden wireless speaker.">PWS</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://mailchimp.com/" title="A templated mailing list system.">MailChimp</a> for our mailing list management and advertising campaigns - this is a wonderful service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://www.zendesk.com/" title="A customer service service.">Zendesk</a> for managing support tickets - another service that makes my life so much easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com/" title="A project management service.">Pivotal Tracker</a> for managing tasks among our four engineers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://stereopsis.com/flux/" title="A tool to make the colour of your screen adapt to the current time of day.">F.Lux</a> for keeping my eyes from burning out.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What would be your dream setup?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m pretty happy with my hardware/software setup these days, but feel like we’re really lacking in the furniture department (given that the table and chairs is our only furniture). Here’s what my dream setup would be: two Herman Miller <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/lounge-seating/eames-lounge-chair-and-ottoman.html" title="A lounge chair with an ottoman.">Eames Lounge Chairs</a>, one Herman Miller <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/multi-use-guest-chairs/eames-molded-plywood-chairs.html" title="A chair.">Eames LCW</a>, one J. Rusten <a href="http://jrusten.com/2010/07/orchard-slab-table/" title="A unique wooden table.">Orchard Slab Table</a>, and maybe a Wells Sofa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately this would set us back around $15k, so I’ll just keep dreaming for now.</p>', 'fashion,mac', '2013-11-21 00:00:00', 000, 1, '2013-11-21 06:03:21');
