(1, '访谈', '工作', 'Kiah Roache-Turner', 'Feature film-maker (Wyrmwood)', '2013/kiah.roache-turner.jpg', '<h4>Who are you, and what do you do?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>My name is Kiah Roache-Turner and I guess I could say that I’m an advertising director &amp; (more recently) a feature film-maker… but that would not be the case. What I am is an individual who is COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY OBSESSED with films. An absolute film geek and movie obsessive. All I ever wanted to be and all I ever will be is a Movie Director. In my civilian life I work for a fashion company part time creating online content and spend the other half of my REEL life making films, music videos and occasionally digital art for digital art’s sake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I just finished shooting my first full-length film ‘<a href="https://www.facebook.com/wyrmwoodmovie" title="Wyrmwood''s Facebook page.">Wyrmwood</a>’ - a fantasy/horror/sci-fi/action/post-apocalyptic mash-up of a movie that took me and my producer brother 3 years to complete. It’s been the most difficult and rewarding thing I’ve ever attempted in my life. I poured my entire heart and soul into the project and bled sweat and tears to make sure I made one hell-ovva’ kick-arse first film and I feel I’ve succeeded - only time will tell, however… it’ll come out early next year.  </p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What hardware do you use?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I just bought a new <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/" title="The all-in-one Mac.">iMac</a> with which to edit the rough-cut of my fillum and it’s been working like a dream. As an arty aesthete I LOVE the design and workflow of Macs, however I hear that a custom-built PC gives you more grunt for your bucks and as I do a fair bit of complicated 3D rendering at work we recently made the switch (literally yesterday) so I may become a convert yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’ve shot pretty consistently on Canon DSLR’s (the <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=139&amp;modelid=11933" title="A 12 megapixel DSLR.">5D1</a>, the <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=139&amp;modelid=17662" title="A 21 megapixel DSLR.">5D2</a> &amp; the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS-1D" title="A 4 megapixel DSLR.">1D</a>) for the last few years. I think for certain projects (especially online work) these cameras are great - however, I’ve recently started using some much sexier cams and to be honest the difference is pretty huge. For ease of use and picture quality the <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/professional/products/professional_cameras/cinema_eos_cameras/eos_c300" title="A 35mm digital video camera.">Canon C300</a> and the <a href="http://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/product-NEXFS700UK/" title="A 4k digital video camera.">Sony FS700</a> are brilliant and the fact that you can do ‘HD’ 200 frames-per-second slow motion on the Sony is a HUGE plus for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href="http://www.red.com/products/epic/" title="A high-end 4k digital video camera.">Red EPIC</a> and the <a href="http://www.red.com/products/scarlet" title="A high-end 4k digital video camera.">Red Scarlet</a> are amazing cameras also - I shot a big chunk of my feature on these guys and was massively impressed with the results. They’ve got a very filmic look and the 4k RAW file capabilities give you an amount of flexibility in the ‘post grading’ process that the other cameras can’t come close to. I would certainly never think of shooting another film on a camera that coudn’t shoot in this format. I’m a big believer that if you’re good enough at what you do you should be able to make something as beautiful and moving with a 5 dollar camera as another guy could make with a hundred thousand dollar camera but… well, damn but you just can’t help but love those high-end toys!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>And what software?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I recently made the switch from <a href="http://www.apple.com/finalcutstudio/finalcutpro/" title="A nonlinear video editor.">Final Cut Pro</a> to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" title="A video editing suite.">Adobe Premiere</a> (for editing) and am (after only one day of cutting) a no-holds-barred convert. It is superior in every way, an absolute dream for any filmmaker to work with and not too hard to learn at all. I love that fact that you can drag any type of video file format directly onto the timeline without pre-conversion and the interactive ‘video thumbnails’ save a gargantuan amount of time when sorting through footage. I use <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects/" title="Motion graphics and video editing software.">After Effects</a> for all my 3D title &amp; design work and <a href="http://adobe.com/products/photoshop/" title="The infamous graphic editor.">Photoshop</a> a fair bit for various bits and pieces. I write all my scripts in <a href="http://www.finaldraft.com/products/final-draft/" title="Popular screenwriting software.">Final Draft</a> (a great program for writers) and a bunch of other programs that really aren’t worth mentioning.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What would be your dream setup?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>To be completely honest the longer I make films the longer I realise that my dream setup would probably be that everybody does everything for me - from a technical standpoint anyway. I’m fast learning that there are a lot of people out there who are far more technically minded than I am and far better at what they do but there are not many people who are better at speaking the language of cinema (that I know) and that is really what I should stick to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having said that, the one possible exception is probably editing - I truly love losing myself in an edit and tend to prefer to do it solo. So…  my dream setup would be the latest disgustingly expensive Mac processor with three huge monitors, large subwoofers in a roomy, dark, leather-padded room with lush couches, a bar-fridge and a Thai masseuse on speed-dial waiting to assist me with the inevitable RSI that comes with editing 24 hours a day for months. Is that too much to ask?</p>', 'film,mac', '2013-11-19 20:24:46', 000, 1, '2013-11-19 20:24:52'),
(2, '访谈', '工作', 'Stephen Powell', 'Co-founder, Gustin', '2013/stephen.powell.jpg', '<h4>Who are you, and what do you do?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>My name is Stephen Powell, and I’m one of two founders of the menswear company <a href="http://www.weargustin.com/" title="The Gustin website.">Gustin</a>. We design and manufacture premium men’s clothing in SF, and use crowdsourcing to do it very efficiently - resulting in very low prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re a pretty small shop - I mainly work on our platform (outsourced), fulfillment (outsourced), marketing (outsourced), community management (in-house), and I take out the trash.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What hardware do you use?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>My personal technology stack is pretty standard for here in SF.\r\nMy laptop is a loaded 13” <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookair/" title="The super-thin Intel-based Mac laptop.">Macbook Air</a>. It’s the best laptop ever, super easy to drag around everywhere with me, and more than fast enough for the <a href="http://adobe.com/products/photoshop/" title="The infamous graphic editor.">Photoshop</a> work I have to do. I use my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_5S" title="A smartphone.">iPhone 5s</a> for photography (mostly <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252" title="A photo taking/sharing app.">Instagram</a>), and phone calls. My Macbook is almost always with me, so I do almost no work on my phone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think my favorite piece of hardware we have is <a href="http://instagram.com/p/eOWLw-DgZ6/" title="A photo of Gustin''s table">our table</a>. When we first moved into our space, we were working around a large dining table. Dining tables feel pretty narrow when you’ve got four people working with laptops, so we decided to build our own massive table. We constructed this using some old steel legs we had, and the top is built out of Williamsburg Butcher Block Co countertops. The whole thing is about 50” x 90”, which gives us plenty of room to spread out fabrics, samples, and get work done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also have an <a href="http://instagram.com/p/fBjaxTDgSE/" title="A photo of Gustin''s kickpress.">oldschool iron kickpress</a> in the office. We haven’t used it yet, but it’s a nice accent to our space.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>And what software?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I thought my answer to this was going to be pretty simple, but when I started listing it out, I realized that I rely on a lot more software than I would have thought. Roughly in order of importance, here’s what helps me run my life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://adiumx.com/" title="The excellent multi-chat-protocol Mac application.">Adium</a> for chatting - we use it to stay in constant communication with the team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/" title="A cloud storage service.">Google Drive</a> for sharing data around the team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://macromates.com/" title="A very popular text editor for the Mac.">TextMate</a> as my daily scratchpad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://www.pgadmin.org/" title="A GUI for managing PostgresSQL databases.">pgAdmin3</a> for querying our databases - this ends up getting dumped into <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/default.aspx" title="A popular spreadsheet application.">Excel</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://www.github.com/" title="A Git code repository service.">GitHub</a> for managing our codebase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://www.pandora.com/" title="A personalised Internet radio station.">Pandora</a> for the constant music in the office (played on our <a href="http://grainaudio.com/collections/handheld/products/pws" title="A wooden wireless speaker.">PWS</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://mailchimp.com/" title="A templated mailing list system.">MailChimp</a> for our mailing list management and advertising campaigns - this is a wonderful service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://www.zendesk.com/" title="A customer service service.">Zendesk</a> for managing support tickets - another service that makes my life so much easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com/" title="A project management service.">Pivotal Tracker</a> for managing tasks among our four engineers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://stereopsis.com/flux/" title="A tool to make the colour of your screen adapt to the current time of day.">F.Lux</a> for keeping my eyes from burning out.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What would be your dream setup?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m pretty happy with my hardware/software setup these days, but feel like we’re really lacking in the furniture department (given that the table and chairs is our only furniture). Here’s what my dream setup would be: two Herman Miller <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/lounge-seating/eames-lounge-chair-and-ottoman.html" title="A lounge chair with an ottoman.">Eames Lounge Chairs</a>, one Herman Miller <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/multi-use-guest-chairs/eames-molded-plywood-chairs.html" title="A chair.">Eames LCW</a>, one J. Rusten <a href="http://jrusten.com/2010/07/orchard-slab-table/" title="A unique wooden table.">Orchard Slab Table</a>, and maybe a Wells Sofa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately this would set us back around $15k, so I’ll just keep dreaming for now.</p>', 'fashion,mac', '2013-11-21 00:00:00', 000, 1, '2013-11-21 14:03:21'),
(3, '访谈', '工作', 'Romain Guy', 'Software developer, photographer', '2013/romain.guy.jpg', '<h4>Who are you, and what do you do?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://www.curious-creature.org/" title="Romain''s website.">Romain Guy</a>. I’m a software developer and photographer. I work at Google where I’ve spent the past 6 years helping ship every version of <a href="http://code.google.com/android/" title="A mobile phone platform.">Android</a>. I have also done a lot of developer community support and outreach through talks, articles, etc. I recently changed team a few weeks ago to join a new exciting project. In a past life I worked as a tech journalist for French magazines, a books translator, a University teacher, a tech writer…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photography is mostly a hobby but I sometimes license my work. One of my photos was part of the recent <a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/5/" title="An Android smartphone.">Nexus 5</a> launch and marketing campaign, for instance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What hardware do you use?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>At work I rely on a powerful workstation, a 12-core <a href="http://www.apple.com/macpro/" title="The Intel-based Mac tower computer.">Mac Pro</a> with 24 GB of RAM, hooked up to a 30” <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003RBNMJA" title="A 30 inch LCD screen.">HP ZR30w</a> and a 24” <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;sku=320-6272" title="A 24 inch LCD screen.">Dell 2408WFP</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do most of my photo editing and processing at home on a 2008 8-core Mac Pro with 8 GB of RAM and a 30” <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/products/Monitors/productdetail.aspx?sku=222-7175" title="Dell''s 30 inch widescreen LCD monitor.">Dell 3007WFP</a>. I use a large array of internal and external hard drives - both USB and Firewire - to create 4 daily backups of my work. It seems overkill but in an incredible string of bad luck I once lost 4 of my 5 copies during the span of 2 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For pretty much everything else I use an 11” <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookair/" title="The super-thin Intel-based Mac laptop.">MacBook Air</a>. I take it almost everywhere with me and it’s powerful enough that I use it for photo editing and processing when I’m on the road or traveling abroad. It’s the machine on which I do all of my writing and presentations editing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I use a <a href="https://www.google.com/nexus/4/" title="An Android smartphone.">Nexus 4</a> everywhere I go and I sometimes bring along a <a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/#/7" title="A popular Android tablet.">Nexus 7</a> (2013) or a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Touch-light/dp/B007OZNZG0" title="An e-book reader with a book-like screen.">Kindle Paperwhite</a>. The Kindle is probably the best device I’ve ever owned and it’s a great companion when I’m waiting for sunset when I’m out taking photos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of photography, I now use a <a href="http://usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/slr_cameras/eos_5d_mark_iii" title="A 22.3 megapixel DSLR.">Canon 5D Mk III</a> for all of my landscape work. For street, travel, portrait and personal photography I rely on a <a href="http://us.leica-camera.com/photography/m_system/m_new/" title="A 24 megapixel digital camera.">Leica M</a>. The Leica M is both the best and one of the worsts cameras I’ve used. I love using it for its simplicity and the feel of it. Ming Thein describes it best in his piece about “<a href="http://blog.mingthein.com/2013/03/27/film-diaries-hapatics-1/" title="An article about hapatics and tactility in cameras.">tactility</a>”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My equipment is carefully chosen to fit in a small <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00009R8AI" title="A camera satchel.">Domke F-803 shoulder bag</a>. I can pack a MacBook Air 11”, a Leica M with a couple of lenses, a Kindle or Nexus 7 and have everything I need to write software, give talks at conferences and take and process photos.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>And what software?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m a big fan of IDEs for software development - I used to use 3 at the same time when I was working on Android: <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" title="A developer''s IDE.">IntelliJ IDEA</a> and 2 instances of <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" title="A flexible, open-source IDE.">Eclipse</a>. <a href="http://macromates.com/" title="A very popular text editor for the Mac.">TextMate</a> is my swiss-army knife for everything else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After trying numerous alternatives years ago, I have settled on <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom/" title="Photo management and editing software.">Lightroom</a> to do all of my photo editing and processing. <a href="http://adobe.com/products/photoshop/" title="The infamous graphic editor.">Photoshop CC</a> is a vital part of my photo processing workflow but I also use it for UI design and to illustrate articles and talks. It’s rare to find apps one actually enjoys using for long hours, but both Lightroom and Photoshop are such apps for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do all of my writing in <a href="http://bywordapp.com/" title="A full-screen writing tool for the Mac.">Byword</a> and <a href="http://markedapp.com" title="A Markdown preview tool for Mac text editors.">Marked</a>. I love being able to work distraction-free in simple environments that let me focus on content. I am a big fan of <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/" title="Presentation software for the Mac.">Keynote</a> and <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/" title="Diagramming software for the Mac.">OmniGraffle</a> to create technical presentations. I wish Apple dedicated more resources to Keynote as it’s starting to feel a little stale. The recent update is a welcome refresh but I hope to see more soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a few other tools I could not be productive without: <a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password" title="Password management and automatic form filler software for OS X.">1Password</a>, <a href="http://www.sparrowmailapp.com/" title="A mail client for the Mac with a funky UI.">Sparrow</a>, <a href="http://getdropbox.com/" title="Online syncing and storage.">DropBox</a>, <a href="http://evernote.com/" title="Online software for capturing notes.">Evernote</a> and <a href="http://www.6wunderkinder.com/wunderlist/" title="A cloud-syncing to-do manager.">Wunderlist</a>. These applications are fantastic content lockers that help me free my mind. Evernote, for instance, is my digital library where I store all the reference material I need for my various projects. <a href="http://google.com/chrome" title="A WebKit-based browser, where each tab runs in its own thread.">Chrome</a> is another important tool to me. Its profiles feature helps me juggle between 4 different Google accounts with ease and with the recent introduction of Chromecast it has even become one of my best media players.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On my Android devices, I’m an avid user of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideashower.readitlater.pro" title="An app for the read-it-later service.">Pocket</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twentyfivesquares.press" title="A feed reading app.">Press</a>, <a href="http://getfalcon.pro/" title="A Twitter client for Android..">Falcon Pro</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.talk" title="An app for Google Hangouts.">Hangouts</a>, <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.android.gm" title="A Gmail client for Android.">Gmail</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.music" title="An app for the music streaming service.">Google Music</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onepassword.passwordmanager" title="A password storage app.">1Password</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dropbox.android" title="An app for the storage service.">Dropbox</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evernote" title="An app for the note taking service.">Evernote</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wunderkinder.wunderlistandroid" title="An app for the to-do service.">Wunderlist</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What would be your dream setup?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I am always looking for lighter, thinner and more powerful devices. I would love to see an 11” MacBook Air with a high-density display and a (much) better gamut. The current 11” is pretty terrible for serious color work. The Leica M is a heavy camera and I would love to use a lighter one that’s as enjoyable to use.

Our bags attach to the bikes with a few bungee cords and rain covers. We keep an extra set of inner tubes, fuel filters, and a small toolkit under the seats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My gear fits inside a 30-liter backpack, currently a black <a href="http://www.rivendellmountainworks.com/shop/mariposa-summit-pack/" title="A big backpack.">Mariposa Summit Pack</a> from Rivendell Mountain Works.

Everything inside my pack is organized inside its own bag; my clothes in a <a href="http://www.seatosummit.com/products/display/1" title="A compression sack.">6L dry compression sack</a>, my toiletries and electronics in separate dry sacks of varying sizes, and everything else in MUJI zipper pouches or mesh sacks. I like to have different color bags so I can memorize by sight where everything is. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traveling light means I do laundry every 2-3 days. As much as I love wearing cotton, wool, and linen, quick dry fabrics are ideal for traveling in places with humid climates and no clothing dryers. ExOfficio makes smart durable travel clothing that won’t make you look like you are about to safari. Their Kizmet shirt is rocking my world. When laundry services aren’t available, I <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002BO60JI/" title="Travel soap.">wash my own clothes</a>. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I always carry a headphone splitter for music sharing opportunities with strangers and a deck cards for roadside Gin Rummy tournaments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a stash of Tender Bens and keep one in my daypack for mosquito-control emergencies. A pack of wet wipes is always in my pocket for everything from roadside peeing to pre-meal hand washing. Wet wipes top the list, after my passport, of items I can’t travel without. I keep earplugs and an eye mask for overnight flights and midnight karaoke weddings happening outside the guesthouse. When confronted with an overstuffed or insufficient pillow, I’m grateful to have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0047BXDBG" title="An inflatable travel pillow.">this inflatable one</a>. Love <a href="http://www.humangear.com/gotoob/" title="A squeezable travel bottle.">GoToobs</a> for leak-free shampoo containment. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I carry a pair of straps for attaching my sleeping bag to the outside of my pack and for impromptu laundry lines and curtain ties. This <a href="http://shop.eaglecreek.com/3dial-tsa-lock-and-cable/d/1075" title="A lock and cable.">lock with cable</a> is great for securing my pack to furniture, luggage racks, or my motorbike.

(5, '访谈', '工作', 'Jeffrey Ely', 'Professor of economics (Northwestern University)', '2013/jeffrey.ely.jpg', '<h4>Who are you, and what do you do?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I am Jeffrey Ely, Professor of Economics at Northwestern University. I teach and do research on game theory and information economics. Basically I try to understand how to channel selfish motivations into good social outcomes. I write a blog called <a href="http://cheaptalk.org/" title="The Cheap Talk site.">Cheap Talk</a>, which is mostly about how to think about everyday situations through the lens of economics and game theory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently I have started a venture modernizing pricing mechanisms for sports, concerts, etc called <a href="http://www.nupurplepricing.com/" title="A smart sport game ticket service.">Purple Pricing</a>. My partner, Sandeep Baliga, and I are applying our game theory research to understand how to remove gamesmanship from the ticket-buying experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What hardware do you use?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I have Macs everywhere. <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookair/" title="The super-thin Intel-based Mac laptop.">MacBook Air</a> is my portable, an old <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/" title="The consumer Mac laptop.">MacBook</a> repurposed as a desktop at home and an <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/" title="The all-in-one Mac.">iMac</a> in the office. My phone is an <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/" title="A smartphone.">iPhone 5</a>. For most of my adult life, however, I was a Linux devotee. This was partly hobby and partly for the power/flexibility/freedom of Unix and free software. As I get older other hobbies have taken the forefront and I have less time for messing with things like ifconfig and Xorg.conf but I still rely on Linux for my mail server, <a href="http://www.python.org/" title="An interpreted scripting language.">Python</a>, and various tools that don’t exist anywhwere else. So I have a tiny little box under my desktop which runs an incredibly minimal headless <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" title="A popular Unix distribution.">Ubuntu</a> installation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>And what software?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The three most important pieces of software for me are <a href="http://macromates.com/" title="A very popular text editor for the Mac.">TextMate</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/" title="A fast web browser.">Safari</a> running on the Mac, and <a href="http://www.postfix.org/" title="Mail server software.">Postfix</a>/IMAP running on my Linux box. With TextMate I write papers in <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/" title="Typesetting software.">LaTeX</a>, with Safari I write my blog and waste precious time and my mail server setup is responsible for organizing pretty much all of my life. I have about 10 different email addresses which keep different parts of my life in their own channels. I write probably 20 emails to myself a day consisting of reminders, thoughts jotted-down and just general life-journalism. I think most standalone software for “getting organized” is redundant once one understands how to get the most out of old-fashioned email.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What would be your dream setup?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Computers have ceased being an end in themselves for me now - I just think of hardware and software as just a means to get as quickly as possible past the routine and to the novelty-horizon of whatever I am working on. So my dream setup would simply be to have some combination of secretarial staff and predictive algorithm that can figure out at every moment what I need done but am not interested in doing myself and do it for me. Barring that I think my setup right now is pretty efficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I could ask for a marginal improvement in technology it would be to allow me to compose emails easily in all possible situations as unobtrusively as possible. Thoughts arrive at any old time and I want to get them down as soon as I have them organized. I would like to come as close to direct transcription of my thoughts as possible. Siri is getting closer because I can dictate emails even in my car while driving. But I can’t use Siri when I am in the middle of a conversation and need to momentarily mentally check out to record an idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could imagine some kind of device on my index finger where I can write words in air, even with my hands in my pockets, and the device figures out what i am writing and puts it in an email addressed to me.</p>', 'linux,mac,professor', '2013-11-04 22:34:17', 000, 1, '2013-11-23 22:37:41'),

I have been studying and programming computers since I was 12 years old. I have been an entrepreneur, a government researcher and a university professor. I once designed, built and sold software for a living. Somewhat by accident, I became a computer science professor but my true love is hacking. These days, I do research on indexing problems, trying to milk recent processors for bleeding edge performance. It is really an excuse to write crazy software. Most of my software is published as <a href="https://github.com/lemire" title="Daniel''s GitHub account.">open source software</a>. I have also been blogging weekly since 2004 about computer science and related topics.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What hardware do you use?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I own two MacBooks: a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookair/" title="The super-thin Intel-based Mac laptop.">MacBook Air</a> and a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/" title="The popular Intel-based Mac laptop.">MacBook Pro</a>. Both are less than two years old. I also own an old <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/" title="The all-in-one Mac.">iMac</a>. I spend most of my time on the MacBook Air because it is light and powerful enough. I should stress that I can work at the oddest of places, from my bed up to the local coffee place. I cannot stand office chairs and desk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My campus laboratory is mostly made of Linux boxes that I share with my students and collaborators. This is where the expensive computations happen, not on my laptops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also own several tablets (both Android and iOS). I mostly use my iPad however: I was an early iPad adopter and I have since upgraded to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_(4th_generation)" title="A 9.7 inch iOS tablet.">iPad 4</a>. I am very pleased. I have since thrown away my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/kindle/" title="A digital book reader.">Kindle ebook reader</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do not own a cell phone. The best way to reach me is by email. I do, however, carry a Garmin GPS, a high-end compact camera and a WiFi tablet in my backpack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do own a TV, but it never gets used as a TV: I don’t have cable. However, it is connected to a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/" title="The lil'' Intel-based Mac.">Mac Mini</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi" title="A single-board hackable computer.">Rasberry Pi</a>, a Playstation and a Nintendo <a href="http://www.wii.com/" title="A unique gaming console.">Wii U</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also own a <a href="http://www.google.com/chromebook/" title="A laptop built for only running Web apps.">ChromeBook</a>, but it is mostly for my kids or for traveling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Occasionally, I hack electronics so I have a tiny maker lab in my basement filled with transistors and <a href="http://arduino.cc/" title="Open-source prototyping hardware.">Arduinos</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though I own an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/" title="The infamous music player.">iPod</a> and it is somewhere in my living room, we never listen to any music. We are a quiet family and I like my office to be quiet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do drink a massive amount of coffee however. I roast my own coffee with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/FreshRoast-SR500-Automatic-Coffee-Roaster/dp/B0034D9ONO" title="A coffee bean roaster.">Fresh Roast SR500</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At home, I own a ridiculously large and expensive wireless Brother printer, but I rarely print anything. A few years back, I threw away most of my paper books and all of my xeroxed articles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I always carry a small notebook and a pen. More than anything else, it keeps me sane.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>And what software?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>On my Macs, I use <a href="http://www.peterborgapps.com/smultron/" title="A text editor for the Mac.">Smultron</a> as a text editor when I am not in a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/" title="A popular terminal shell.">bash</a> shell, despite the fact that it is buggy. However, most of my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" title="A compiled programming language.">C++</a> and <a href="http://www.java.com/" title="A cross-platform compiled programming language.">Java</a> hacking is done using an older version of <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" title="A flexible, open-source IDE.">Eclipse</a>. I should stress that I mostly use Eclipse as a fancy programming text editor: my programming happens in command shells. For C/C++, I use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html" title="Software to prepare code for compilation.">makefiles</a>, and for Java, I use <a href="http://maven.apache.org/" title="Software project management softare.">maven</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For web browsing, I use <a href="http://google.com/chrome" title="A WebKit-based browser, where each tab runs in its own thread.">Google Chrome</a>. As a <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/" title="Typesetting software.">LaTeX</a> editor, I use <a href="https://www.texpadapp.com/osx" title="A LaTeX editor for the Mac.">Texpad</a>. When people send me office documents, I open them with <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" title="An open-source office suite.">OpenOffice</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My iPad mostly is most just used to play video and the standard Google apps like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/youtube/id544007664" title="A YouTube client for iOS.">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google+/id447119634" title="A Google+ client for iOS.">Google Plus</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I connect to a Linux box, I use <a href="http://www.vim.org/" title="A popular command-line text editor.">vim</a> as a text editor. For various reasons, I tend to write a lot of my software in vim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I use an <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" title="A popular Unix distribution.">Ubuntu</a> distro for Linux, mostly because it is the most popular option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For managing my time, I rely mostly on a private wiki I have setup (it runs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikkaWiki" title="A PHP-based wiki engine.">Wikka</a>). I have designed a system inspired by GTD that allows me to prioritize tasks and keep track of future projects. It works in conjunction with the notebook I always carry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My blog runs on a self-hosted (and slightly hacked) version of <a href="http://wordpress.com/" title="Weblog publishing software.">Wordpress</a>. It gets backed up to my iMac every week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I give presentations, I like to use <a href="http://prezi.com/" title="Web-based presentations.">Prezi</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I need to draw diagrams, I use <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/" title="Diagramming software for the Mac.">Omnigraffle</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I never crunch numbers with a spreadsheet: I prefer to use text files and <a href="http://www.python.org/" title="An interpreted scripting language.">Python</a>. I generate my plots using a mix of <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/" title="A command-line graphing tool.">Gnuplot</a> and Python.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To sign forms electronically, I have been using something called <a href="https://code.google.com/p/formulatepro/" title="A Mac tool for editing PDFs.">FormulatePro</a>. It gets the job done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of my important content is on <a href="http://www.github.com/" title="A Git code repository service.">GitHub</a> these days though I still use <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" title="A popular version control system.">Subversion</a> for some legacy stuff. I also occasionally use <a href="http://getdropbox.com/" title="Online syncing and storage.">Dropbox</a>, especially when I need to deal with pesky office documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I must attend a meeting, I like to rely on <a href="http://www.skype.com/" title="Voice and video chat software.">Skype</a> though I have had good luck with <a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/" title="A voice, video and text chat service.">Google Hangouts</a> too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What would be your dream setup?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>If I could find a way to make office documents go away, it would simplify my workflow. There would be no phone in sight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Short of that, I’d like to be able to do all my work from a device no more intrusive than a tablet.

It’s important for me to be able to run programs from the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/" title="A collection of popular design tools (Photoshop, etc.).">Adobe Creative Suite</a> and still have <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" title="An interpreted scripting language.">ruby</a> and other local servers running in the background, as well as multiple browsers. I haven’t upgraded to a Retina Macbook yet, I’m holding on to the hope that Apple will release a Retina <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookair/" title="The super-thin Intel-based Mac laptop.">Air</a>. That would be ideal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes I use a <a href="http://www.apple.com/displays/" title="A Thunderbolt-powered monitor.">Cinema Thunderbolt display</a>. I like to be mobile and I often work from home, as well as around the world, so I usually just stick with my Macbook, but when I’m in the office a bunch I use the display for more visual real estate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>And what software?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I mostly design in browser, but I use CS6 (again, late on the update) <a href="http://adobe.com/products/photoshop/" title="The infamous graphic editor.">Photoshop</a> to save assets and on the very rare occasion that I’m doing any illustration work, it’ll be in <a href="http://adobe.com/products/illustrator/" title="A popular vector graphics editor.">Illustrator</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I spend most of my time in <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2" title="A coder''s text editor.">Sublime Text</a>. Designing in markup and CSS, I’m constantly saving and refreshing in my browser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do browsers count as software? If so, <a href="http://google.com/chrome" title="A WebKit-based browser, where each tab runs in its own thread.">Google Chrome</a> is where I do most of my work. I use the <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/" title="Web developer tools built into Chrome.">developer tools</a> like web inspector to <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/elements-styles" title="An article about using the Chrome DevTools to edit CSS elements.">manipulate mockups</a> or apps locally and then make those changes in my text editor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GitHub, GitHub, GitHub. I live in the <a href="http://zachholman.com/talk/how-github-uses-github-to-build-github/" title="A talk about GitHub''s workflow.">GitHub workflow</a> which usually looks something like this: pull down code from remote repository, make changes locally, test my changes, push code back up to GitHub. GitHub now has <a href="https://github.com/blog/1557-github-flow-in-the-browser" title="A post about the GitHub Flow.">an entire flow in the browser</a> that I use to make small changes like fixing typos. Because I use <a href="http://pages.github.com/" title="A simple GitHub-based web publishing system.">GitHub Pages</a> for most of the static websites I build, I can just commit the changes in browser and the page builds happen almost instantaneously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I honestly couldn’t live without <a href="http://colorsnapper.com/" title="A colour picker for the Mac.">ColorSnapper</a>. I never learned color theory and I didn’t go to art school. I’ve mostly trained my eye for good design, so I depend pretty heavily on being able to color pick the web to recreate a look or effect. It’s also handy for converting hex values into RGBs and vice-versa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I use <a href="http://www.getcloudapp.com/" title="A cloud-based file sharing menubar app for OS X.">CloudApp</a> obsessively. As a designer, I’m constantly taking screenshots of my work for both my own use and records as well as sharing it with my coworkers and peers. I post screenshots to Pull Requests to get feedback from teammates and get developers excited about what I’m hacking on. Because we work remotely a ton, we often aren’t up to speed with what everyone else is working on. Screenshots are a big part of how we relay what we’re working on to other Hubbers. Added bonus: CloudApp automagically copies a link from the most recent screenshot you’ve taken to your clipboard. It’s removed several steps from my workflow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail.html" title="The default Mac OS X mail client.">Apple Mail</a>. I do a lot of outreach work in our community and I manage most of my GitHub notifications from my inbox, so I use Mail a ton. I’ve set up a keyboard shortcut to archive directly from my inbox list. So that saves me a ton of time when wading through inbound notifications and random junk that piles up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I used to use the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/" title="The operating system for the Mac platform.">Mac OS</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stickies_(software)" title="Desktop note software for the Mac.">sticky notes</a> for jotting things down until I got tired of them covering my desktop. As an alternative, I started using <a href="http://notational.net/" title="A clever note-taking app for the Mac.">Notational Velocity</a> a few years ago, which is rad for note taking and general to-do list chicken scratch. It’s also fully searchable and you can sync all of your “notes” to the cloud with <a href="http://simplenoteapp.com/" title="A iPhone note app with cloud syncing.">simplenote</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/messages/" title="A messaging platform.">iMessage</a>: I use iMessage to chat to people during my work day. I sync my old AIM accounts, my personal phone number, and my <a href="http://mail.google.com/" title="Web-based email.">Gmail</a> accounts. It’s great to access all of those contacts through the same interface.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What would be your dream setup?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m dying for a Macbook Air with more memory and a Retina screen. At GitHub, so many of us work remotely and on the go. We’ve built a company around being able to do that. So, I’m just waiting for the right tech to come along to compliment that mobility, or at least one that would play nicely with the software I use. :fingers_crossed:</p>', 'designer,developer,mac,web', '2013-10-21 11:24:22', 000, 1, '2013-11-24 11:25:43'),

This particular snapshot of me features:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Writing lots of software. My <a href="https://github.com/steveklabnik" title="Steve''s GitHub account.">GitHub profile</a> claims that I’ve contributed 2880 things to various projects in the last 365 days. My longest streak was 126 days. In a row!</li>\r\n  <li>Reading lots of philosophy books. Mostly those French guys you roll your eyes at.</li>\r\n  <li>Travel. I got my passport in 2010, and put a single stamp in it. In 2011, I got 4 more. At this point, I will need more pages shortly after the new year.</li>\r\n  <li>Waiting patiently for the fall of capitalism. If I could help accelerate this I would. Getting kinda impatient over here.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>What hardware do you use?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now I use an <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/x-series/x1-carbon/" title="A lightweight PC laptop with a 14 inch screen.">X1 Carbon</a> for all of my computing. It’s whatever its max specs are. Once there is 100% free hardware that’s full-sized, I’ll buy it. The Carbon is pretty damn close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before I started caring strongly about my personal freedoms I was a staunch Apple user. I got rid of a 13” <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookair/" title="The super-thin Intel-based Mac laptop.">MacBook Air</a> when I acquired this machine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until this year, I did not have a cell phone. I have an <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/" title="A smartphone.">iPhone 5</a> now. After my two years are up, I’ll probably go without one again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I just want to mindlessly consume, I use a full-sized iPad. It’s pretty okay for reading the web, great at PDFs, and has fun games.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>And what software?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I currently run <a href="http://crunchbang.org/" title="A Linux distro.">#!</a> (pronounced kɹʌntʃbæŋ(ɡ)) Linux. I like it. I use <a href="http://www.archlinux.org/" title="A Linux distro.">Arch Linux</a> most of the time, but I gave #! a go this time so I wouldn’t have to fiddle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I use a tiling window manager. Usually it’s <a href="http://xmonad.org/" title="A tiling window manager for X11.">XMonad</a>, but #! comes with <a href="http://openbox.org/" title="A window manager for *nix.">OpenBox</a>, and it’s pretty okay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I spend 80% of my time in <a href="http://mozilla.com/firefox/" title="The very popular open-source cross-platform web browser.">Firefox</a> and an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xterm" title="Terminal software for the X Window System.">xterm</a>. Inside that xterm, I run <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/" title="A popular terminal shell.">bash</a>, <a href="http://www.vim.org/" title="A popular command-line text editor.">vim</a>, <a href="http://git-scm.com/" title="A version control system.">git</a>, and <a href="http://irssi.org/" title="A popular CLI irc client.">irssi</a>. I need to get better at <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/" title="A terminal multiplexer, similar to screen.">tmux</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I spend 10% of my time in <a href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/" title="An open-source cross-platform mail client.">Thunderbird</a>, for email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I spend another 8% of my time using tools to protect my privacy, like <a href="https://torproject.org/" title="A software and network package for protecting your anonymity.">Tor</a> and <a href="http://gnupg.org/" title="Encryption and signing software.">GPG</a>, and 1% in random things I don’t use often enough to remember. Like occasionally I’ll need to edit a picture and open <a href="http://www.gimp.org/" title="An open-source image editor.">GIMP</a> or need to open some sort of document that <a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/" title="A free, open-source productivity suit.">LibreOffice</a> can handle. Occasionally I’ll get an instant message on <a href="http://www.pidgin.im/" title="An open-source multi-protocol chat client.">Pidgin</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I write my presentations in <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/" title="An HTML-based presentation tool.">Reveal.js</a> or the ‘<a href="http://rabbit-shocker.org/en/" title="Ruby-based presentation software.">rabbit</a>’ gem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the iPhone I mostly use <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/messages/" title="A messaging platform.">iMessage</a> and the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/twitter/id333903271" title="The official Twitter app for the iPhone.">Twitter app</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the iPad I mostly practice with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/duolingo-learn-spanish-french/id570060128" title="An app for learning languages.">Duolingo</a> and play <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rerave/id417137196" title="A reaction game.">ReRave</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I use a few web services, though I’m generally replacing them with equivalent desktop apps, or copies that I run on my own servers. I run a Jabber server with <a href="http://www.ejabberd.im/" title="XMPP server software.">ejabberd</a>, and will soon have a full replacement for <a href="http://google.com/apps/intl/en/business/" title="A hosted solution for email, calendaring and more.">Google Apps</a>, which I’ve used over the last few years. <a href="http://twitter.com/" title="An online micro-blogging platform.">Twitter</a> and Duolingo are the two largest that I use right now that I don’t have a good replacement for. I enjoy <a href="http://www.github.com/" title="A Git code repository service.">GitHub</a>, but could live without it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, I don’t tweak my configuration files.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>steveklabnik@dhwty:~$ cat ~/.vimrc\r\nsyntax on\r\nfiletype plugin indent on\r\n\r\nset expandtab\r\n\r\nset paste\r\nset ruler\r\nsteveklabnik@dhwty:~$\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Yup.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What would be your dream setup?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>A computer that actually worked, and worked correctly most of the time. I’ve been searching for quite a while, such a thing seems not to actually exist. I have a sneaking suspicion software is fundamentally, irreparably broken. But a man can dream…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given that can probably never exist, a more realistic dream is a machine that has 100% free hardware and software that works well.

(9, '访谈', '工作', 'Ramsey Nasser', 'Computer scientist, game designer', '2013/ramsey.nasser.jpg', '<h4>Who are you, and what do you do?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>My name is Ramsey Nasser. I am a computer scientist, game designer, and educator from Lebanon living in New York. I was an <a href="http://eyebeam.org/people/ramsey-nasser" title="Ramsey''s fellow page.">Eyebeam Fellow</a> and currently teach at a variety of Universities around the city and develop software as a freelancer while working on my own projects. I am particularly interested in code education and the design of programming languages and programming tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What hardware do you use?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/" title="The popular Intel-based Mac laptop.">15” MacBook Pro</a> from 2011 serves as my sole computer. It has 16GB of RAM (which is more than every computer I’ve ever owned combined), so it’s snappy. At home, my 27” <a href="http://www.apple.com/displays/cinema/" title="The LCD display line.">Cinema Display</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/keyboard/" title="The slim keyboard for Macs.">wireless keyboard</a> and trackpad turn my laptop into a desktop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don’t like being plugged in at all times, so I abandoned smart phones a few years ago in favor of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motofone_f3" title="A GSM mobile phone.">Motofone F3</a>. It calls, texts, and gets out of my way. I love it to death! They haven’t made them in a few years, so finding chargers or good batteries is a bit of a challenge, but it really comes close to the perfect phone as far as I’m concerned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of wired internet at home, I have a 4G hot spot from Clear. It works great as domestic WiFi, but it also lets me pick up and work outside when the weather’s nice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my back pocket I always keep a Moleskine Kraft Brown Cahier Journal and a ballpoint pen. I like always having something to jot down notes on or brainstorm visually. The experience of writing on paper with a pen still trumps every note taking app I’ve tried.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I shoot pictures on two cameras: a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_500D" title="A 15.1 megapixel DSLR.">Canon EOS 500D</a> with a <a href="http://usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/ef_lens_lineup/ef_50mm_f_1_8_ii" title="A standard and medium telephoto camera lens.">50mm f1.8</a> lens, and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_A-1" title="A 35mm film camera.">Canon A-1</a> with a variety of non-autofocus lenses, a <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/eos_slr_camera_systems/lenses/ef_50mm_f_1_4_usm" title="A lens for SLR cameras.">50mm f1.4</a> being my favorite. The A1 was my father’s camera in the 80s and my entire childhood was recorded through its lenses. My digital photos turn out a lot better, but shooting on my A1 is so much more of a challenge and has a lot more sentimental value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it’s not raining, a motorcycle is my preferred way of getting around. I ride a stock ‘95 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_CB750#Nighthawk_750" title="A motorcycle.">Honda Nighthawk 750</a> that I love to pieces. It doesn’t excel in any category, but does everything well and is damn near indestructible. My first bike, which I still own, is a gorgeous but perpetually-in-need-of-work ‘76 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_CB360" title="A motorcycle.">Honda CB360</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I still have my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-83_series" title="A graphing calculator.">TI-83</a> graphing calculator on my desk, and it gets used constantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>And what software?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m on <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/" title="The operating system for the Mac platform.">Mac OS</a>, having been a Linux user for a long time. OS X is fine, it works well as a POSIX system and works well as an OS that normal people (which I like to be from time to time) can use. <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/" title="Command-line package manager for OS X.">Homebrew</a> is a must if you’re a hacker using OS X on a daily basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I browse the web using <a href="http://google.com/chrome" title="A WebKit-based browser, where each tab runs in its own thread.">Chrome</a>. The combined search/address bar is a great idea, and the V8 JavaScript engine is noticeably better than other browsers’ scripting support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I drift between text editors over time. I was a long time <a href="http://macromates.com/" title="A very popular text editor for the Mac.">TextMate</a> user, and even maintain a popular <a href="https://github.com/nasser/arduino.tmbundle" title="An Arduino bundle for TextMate.">Arduino bundle</a> for it, but I’m on <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2" title="A coder''s text editor.">Sublime Text</a> now. I love the multiple cursor idiom and the command bar, but still Sublime Text does a lot of things that annoy me. I’m trying to get into <a href="http://www.vim.org/" title="A popular command-line text editor.">Vim</a>, but the keyboard commands still seem arbitrary and non-intuitive. -20 hacker points, I know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most effective tool I’ve ever picked up is <a href="http://notational.net/" title="A clever note-taking app for the Mac.">Notational Velocity</a>, hands down. I use this to record ideas, take notes, manage my todo lists, and almost everything else. It is one of the few things I use daily and have no complaints about. They nailed it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/" title="A launcher app for the Mac.">Alfred</a> serves as my application launcher, although I am not a power user by any stretch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I use <a href="http://www.sparrowmailapp.com/" title="A mail client for the Mac with a funky UI.">Sparrow</a> as my mail client, and I don’t host my mail on GMail. I’ve tried a lot of alternatives, and everything is either GMail-only or not that good. Let me go on record saying I will never forgive Google for <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/07/20/why-googles-sparrow-acquisition-just-ruined-my-morning/" title="An article about Google acquiring Sparrow.">killing Sparrow</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I prototype a lot of my web-based projects on <a href="http://heroku.com/" title="A service for running and deploying Ruby, Node.js, Clojure, Java, Python, and Scala apps.">Heroku</a> and usually migrate them over to my <a href="http://linode.com/" title="A VPS hosting service.">Linode</a> box when they need a more nuanced deployment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of my game development happens in <a href="http://unity3d.com/unity/" title="A cross-platform game development tool.">Unity 3D</a>. It is quick and easy to get something up and running, and Unity’s Component system is quite powerful when used correctly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For long-form writing, I love <a href="http://bywordapp.com/" title="A full-screen writing tool for the Mac.">Byword</a>. It turns my laptop into a typewriter and gets out of my way – perfect.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What would be your dream setup?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I tend to feel that everything is profoundly broken, so my actual dream setup involves rewriting operating systems and applications as we know them from scratch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Short of that, I wouldn’t mind a laptop with a retina display and SSD storage. Longer battery life would also be welcome. I almost never carry a charger with me because of how bulky they are, but I can’t go more than 4 hours without being that guy who bugs you to borrow your power. A good set of speakers or headphones would be awesome, although I couldn’t tell you which ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, and a black ’60s-era <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_/5_motorcycles" title="A motorcycle.">BMW R75/5</a> in mint condition, please.</p>', 'developer,game,mac,scientist', '2013-10-07 11:31:20', 000, 1, '2013-11-24 11:35:04'),
